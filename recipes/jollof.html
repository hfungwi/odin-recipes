 <h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
 <p>This is a foolproof recipe for cooking Jollof rice, West Africa’s most popular dish.</p>
 <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
 <ul>
    <li>meat</li>
    <li>onion and garlic</li>
    <li>Tomato sauce</li>
    <li>basmati rice</li>
    <li>cumin</li>
    <li>egg</li>
    <li>chopped cilantro</li>
    <li>seasoning</li>
 </ul>
 <h4>Steps</h4>
 <P>Here's a brief overview of how to make Nigerian Jollof Rice</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine tomato, red bell pepper, habanero pepper, fresno chili, garlic, ginger, and water in a blender for the sauce. Blend on high until smooth and set aside</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Add onion and salt and sauté until onion starts to soften, 4 to 5 minutes. Clear space in the middle of the pan, add tomato paste, and sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with paprika, curry powder, cumin, thyme, pepper, and turmeric; continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes until everything is well combined.</li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, and stir in the rice, making sure every grain of rice is coated with the oil-tomato mixture. Add bay leaf and chicken bouillon paste.</li>
        <li>Turn heat to high, stir in tomato sauce, and bring to a vigorous simmer. Cover with a tight fitting lid, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 20 minutes. Do not remove the lid or stir rice</li>
        <li>Turn off heat after 20 minutes, and set the timer for 12 minutes. Allow rice to sit and do not remove the lid.</li>
        <li>After the 12 minutes are up, remove lid, and fluff rice with a fork, separating all the grains. Serve garnished with green onions and chopped cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
 <h4>Cook's Note</h4>
    <p>If rice seems to be a little undercooked at this point, stop fluffing. Pat the rice down gently with the back of the fork, cover tightly again, and set heat to medium low. Cook for another 5 minutes, and check again. </p>
